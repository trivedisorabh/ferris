# Title

`2021-06-01`

## Status

`âœ… Accepted`

## Context

We need a consistant strategy for working with Git.

## Decision

We will adopt the [Git-flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching strategy.

## Consequences

We will have a main branch with stable releases and a develop branch with coming features. Our users will be able to access both. It will be clear to contributors how to work with branches in the repo.
