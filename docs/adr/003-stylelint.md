## Status

`âœ… Accepted`

## Context

In a large code base it's important to keep things uniform and clean from errors.

## Decision

We will use Stylelint.

## Consequences

For most developers this has no "major" inpact at all. Some developers might
have opinions about the forced formatting-pattern but that is something we can
adjust over time.
