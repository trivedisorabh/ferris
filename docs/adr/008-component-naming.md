# Component Naming

`2021-07-01`

## Status

`‚ùì Proposed`

## Context

We need to come up with a good naming convention that we can use throughout our components and building blocks (atoms etc) to make them easy to find and use and that doesn't create any conflicts.

## Decision

We will try to enforce naming atoms/components with only one html-element as close as possible to that element. So for example, button will be called simply 'Button', label will be called 'Label' etc. When using this atom/component as a building block for a larger component we will use the initial name and add things to the end of that. So a component containing an 'InputText' and a 'Label' would be called 'InputTextField'.

Furthermore, we will make sure namings concerning different types and the likes thereof also be added to the end of the name. For example, an input type=text will be called 'InputText' rather than 'TextInput' and an input type=number would be known as 'InputNumber' to keep these atoms closely connected by name.

## Consequences

It will be easier to find the right atom/component to use. Furthermore it will be easier to name atoms/components.
