# Architecture Decision Records

`2021-04-12`

## Status

`âœ… Accepted`

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project for future reference, for new developers, and to be able to understand why certain decisions were made.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions. We don't have to follow his syntax to the letter.

## Consequences

See "Context", "Consequences", and "Experience Report" in the article linked above.
